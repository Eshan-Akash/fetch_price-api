Framework - We are using Java framework called Spring Boot to make the API

The API have GET request. And it is having endpoint path api/price

Spring Boot Version - 2.6.6
We have used several dependencies in Spring Boot to enhance the development experience. The following are the dependencies used:
1. Spring Web - module of the Spring Framework that provides support for building web applications.

2. Lombok - a Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes.

3. Spring Boot Dev Tools - a module of the Spring Boot framework that provides a set of tools for developing and testing Spring Boot applications.

4. Jsoup - a Java library for working with real-world HTML.

We are using MVC architecture for smoothen & enhance software development experience.  
This primarily includes making of packages like controllers, exceptions, payloads, services, service impl to implement interfaces and classes accordingly.
